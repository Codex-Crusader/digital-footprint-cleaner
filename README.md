## 🔭 Roadmap

### Future Features & Contributions Welcome:
The current version lays the foundation for identifying personal data online and generating takedown petitions. Future versions will aim to take this further by:
* 🧹 Pruning sensitive data from the internet using legal and ethical methods after identifying digital footprints.
* 📬 Integrating with takedown request portals and email services to automate delivery of removal petitions.
* 🧠 Enhancing link classification using NLP to distinguish between harmless mentions and potentially harmful exposure (e.g., resumes, data leaks, personal contact info).
* 🌍 Expanding international support for region-specific privacy laws (e.g., CCPA, GDPR, India's DPDP Act).
* 🧾 Customizable petition templates based on site and data type.
* 📊 Adding a personal privacy dashboard to track takedown requests, statuses, and threat levels.
* 🕵️ Anonymized community-driven reports to identify new high-risk platforms.
